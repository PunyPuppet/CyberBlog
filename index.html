                <h3>Are Humans the Weakest Link?</h3>
                <h4>Risk</h4>
                <p> When it comes to humans, we believe we are the strongest link. When it comes to cybersecurity, humans are sometimes considered the weakest link. Cybersecurity professionals focus on three primary categories that help them protect data people, processes, and technology. While technology will always have a flaw point, it is logical and obedient. While processes are a set of steps that people follow so they can achieve a consistent outcome. However, unlike technology and processes, people are complex thinkers. They think for themselves and make their own decisions.They could make good decisions or they could make bad decisions. Humans are not perfect ,therefore are predictable because we know they will make a mistake.  However, they can be unpredictable in that we don’t know what the mistake will be. In many instances, people repeat the same mistakes, despite awareness training. Humans can never be anticipated, you will never know when a mistake will happen, or even when a new mistake arrives. Therefore, humans are the weakest link in security. 
While humans may be the weakest link in cybersecurity, they can also be the strongest defense. With proper training and regular reminders, human errors can effectively be mitigated. Employees no longer have to be the weakest link in security, because with the right training and corporate structures in place, they can become a crucial and trusted part of organizations’ defenses.

                <h3>Should Organizations Pay or Not?</h3>
                <h4>Ransomeware</h4>
                <p>
                    What is ransomware? Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. The question of whether or not to pay the ransom is a tricky one, and there are arguments on both sides. On one hand, paying the ransom may be the quickest way to regain access to your files. However, there are several reasons why paying the ransom is not recommended. First, you are giving your full trust to the attackers. There is no guarantee that the attackers will actually provide the decryption key. Second, paying the ransom only encourages future attacks. Finally, paying the ransom may be illegal in some jurisdictions. According to a report by Gartner, law enforcement agencies recommend not paying the ransom, because doing so encourages continued criminal activity. In some cases, paying the ransom could even be illegal, because it provides funding for criminal activity. Most organizations cannot 100% prevent ransomware attacks. The best thing you can do is assume you will be hit and have plans in place that enable a quick response. This includes running through exercises about what happens when an attack occurs. Doing so may reveal unexpected problem areas. In conclusion, paying the ransom is not recommended. Instead, organizations should focus on prevention and response. By having a plan in place and engaging with the right professionals, organizations can minimize the impact of a ransomware attack and recover quickly.
